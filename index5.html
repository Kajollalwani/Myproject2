    <h2>COMMON DOG DISEASES</h2>
    <p>As a dog parent, it is important to recognize the signs and symptoms of common illnesses so you can seek veterinary help for your canine friend as soon as possible. Read on for information about diseases and other medical inflictions that frequently impact dogs.</p>
    <h2>CANCER</h2>
    <p>Causes of Cancer<br>

        Cancer is a “multifactorial” disease, which means it has no known single cause. However, we do know that both hereditary and environmental factors can contribute to the development of cancer in dogs.
        
        <h4>Cancer Symptoms</h4>
        
        <h5>Symptoms of cancer in dogs may include:</h5>
        <ul>
       <li> Lumps (which are not always malignant, but should always be examined by a vet)</li>
        <li>Swelling</li>
        <li>Persistent sores
        <li>Abnormal discharge from any part of the body
        <li>Bad breath</li>
        <li>Black, tarry stools (a symptom of ulcers, which can be caused by mast cell tumors)</li>
        <li>Decreased or loss of appetite</li>
        <li>Difficulty breathing, urinating or defecating</li>
        <li>Diagnosing Cancer in Dogs</li></ul>
        
        If a lump is present, the first step is typically a needle biopsy, which removes a very small tissue sample for microscopic examination of cells. Alternately, surgery may be performed to remove all or part of the lump for diagnosis by a pathologist.
        Radiographs (xrays), ultrasound, blood evaluation and other diagnostic tests may also be helpful in determining if cancer is present or if it has spread.
        Dogs More Prone to Cancer
        
        Though cancer can be diagnosed in dogs of all ages and breeds, it is much more common in older dogs.
        Certain breeds are prone to specific cancers. Boxers, Boston terriers and Golden Retrievers are among the breeds that most commonly develop mast cell tumors or lymphoma, while large and giant breeds like Great Danes and Saint Bernards are much more likely to suffer from bone cancer than smaller breeds.
        It is important to be familiar with the diseases to which your dog might have a breed disposition.
        
       <h5> Cancer Prevention</h5>
        
        Having your dog altered at a young age can dramatically reduce their chance of getting certain types of cancer.
        Breast cancer can be avoided almost completely by having your dog spayed before her first heat cycle, while a neutered male dog has zero chance of developing testicular cancer.
       <h5> Cancer Treatments</h5>
        
        Treatment options vary and depend on the type and stage of cancer.
        Common treatments include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation and immunotherapy or a combination of therapies. Success of treatment depends on the type and extent of the cancer and the aggressiveness of the therapy. Of course, early detection is best.
        Some dog owners opt for no treatment of the cancer, in which case palliative end of life care, including pain relief, should be considered. Regardless of how you proceed after a diagnosis of cancer in your pet, it is very important to consider his quality of life when making future decisions.
        Some cancers can be cured, while others cannot. Please note that if your dog’s cancer is not curable, there are still many things you can do to make your pet feel better. Don’t hesitate to talk to your vet about your options. And remember good nutrition and loving care can greatly enhance your dog’s quality of life.
        Knowing When to Consult Your Vet
        
        Contact your veterinarian immediately if your dog shows any of the clinical signs mentioned on the list above. Should your dog receive a diagnosis of cancer, you may wish to consult a veterinary oncologist, often employed by specialty veterinary practices and teaching hospitals.</p>
    <h2>DIABETES</h2>
    <p>Diabetes can be classified as:
        <ul>
       <li> Type I (lack of insulin production)</li>
        <li>Type II (impaired insulin production along with an inadequate response to the hormone).</li></li>ul>
        The most common form of the disease in dogs is Type I, insulin-dependent diabetes, which occurs when the pancreas is incapable of producing or secreting adequate levels of insulin. Dogs who have Type I diabetes require insulin therapy to survive.
        
        <h5>Diabetes Symptoms in Dogs</h5>
        
        The following are signs that your dog may be diabetic:
       <ul> 
       <li> Change in appetite</li>
        <li>Excessive thirst/increase in water consumption</li>
        <li>Weight loss</li>
        <li>Increased urination</li>
        <li>Unusually sweet-smelling or fruity breath</li>
       <li>Lethargy</li>
       <li> Dehydration</li>
        Urinary tract infections
        <li>Vomiting</li>
        </ul>
        The exact cause of diabetes is unknown. Autoimmune disease, genetics, obesity, chronic pancreatitis, certain medications and abnormal protein deposits in the pancreas can play a major role in the development of the disease.
        
        <h5>Dogs More Prone to Diabetes</h5>
        
        It is thought that obese dogs and female dogs may run a greater risk of developing diabetes later in life (6-9 years of age)
        Some breeds may also have a greater risk, include Australian Terriers, Standard and Miniature Schnauzers, Dachshunds, Poodles, Keeshonds and Samoyeds
        Juvenile diabetes can also be seen and is particularly prevalent in golden retrievers and keeshonds
        Diagnosing Diabetes
        
        To properly diagnose diabetes, your veterinarian will collect information about clinical signs, perform a physical examination and check blood work and urinalysis.
        
        <h5>Treating Diabetes</h5>
        
        Every diabetic dog is an individual and will respond differently to therapy. Diabetes treatment is based on how severe the signs of disease are and whether there are any other health issues that could complicate therapy.
        Some dogs are seriously ill when first diagnosed and require intensive hospitalized care for several days to regulate their blood sugar levels.
        Dogs who are more stable when first diagnosed may respond to oral medication or a high-fiber diet that helps to normalize glucose levels in the blood
        For most dogs, insulin injections are necessary for adequate regulation of blood glucose. Once your pet’s individual insulin treatment is established, typically based on weight, you will be shown how to give him his insulin injections at home.
        Spaying your dog is recommended, as female sex hormones can have an effect on blood sugar levels.
        As your veterinarian will explain, it’s important to always give your dog insulin at the same time every day and feed him regular meals in conjunction with his medication; this allows increased nutrients in the blood to coincide with peak insulin levels. This will lessen the chance that her sugar levels will swing either too high or too low. You can work with your vet to create a feeding schedule around your pet’s medication time. It is also important to avoid feeding your diabetic dog treats that are high in glucose. Regular blood glucose checks are a critical part of monitoring and treating any diabetic patient, and your veterinarian will help you set up a schedule for checking your dog’s blood sugar.
        
        <h4>Diabetes Prevention</h4>
        
        Although a certain form of diabetes—the type found in dogs less than a year of age—is inherited, proper diet and regular exercise can go a long way to avoid the development of diabetes. Aside from other negative effects, obesity is known to contribute to insulin resistance.
        
        If You Suspect Your Dog Has Diabetes
        
        If your dog is showing any abnormal clinical signs as listed above, make an appointment to see your veterinarian immediately. If a diabetic dog is not treated, he can develop secondary health problems like cataracts and severe urinary tract problems. Ultimately, untreated diabetes can cause coma and death.

        <h3>HEARTWORM</h3>
        <p>Heartworm disease is serious and can be fatal.

           <h5>Heartworm Symptoms</h5>
            
            Symptoms of heartworm can include:
            <ul>
            <li>Labored breathing</li>
            <li>Coughing</li>
            <li>Vomiting</li>
            <li>Weight loss, listlessness and fatigue after only moderate exercise</li>
            <li>Some dogs exhibit no symptoms at all until late stages of infection</li>
            <li> Causes</li></ul>
            
            Heartworms are transmitted from animal to animal by mosquitoes.
            An animal must carry at least two heartworms (a male and a female) in order for female heartworms to reproduce.
            Females produce babies called “microfilaria,” which are shed into an animal’s bloodstream but are not capable of directly causing heartworm without first passing through a mosquito.
            Microfilariae must be taken up by biting mosquitoes, and transform into infective larvae over a two-week period inside the insect.
            When a mosquito next bites a susceptible animal, the infective larvae enter the tissues and begin a migration into the blood vessels.
            Heartworms enter an animal’s bloodstream as tiny, invisible larvae, but can reach lengths of more than twelve inches at maturity.
            Diagnosing Heartworm
            
            Heartworm disease is diagnosed by examination, radiographs or ultrasound, and a veterinarian-administered blood test.
            All dogs should be routinely screened with a blood test for heartworm either annually in spring or before being placed on a new prescription for a heartworm preventative.
            Dogs More Prone to Heartworm
            
            Heartworm infestation can happen to any dog, but since mosquitoes are their carriers, dogs who live in hot, humid regions are at greatest risk.
            The disease has been seen in every state except Alaska, but is most common in or on the East Coast, southern United States and Mississippi River Valley.
            <h5>Preventing Heartworm</h5> 
                       Heartworm is easily preventable with an inexpensive, chewable pill or topical medication available as a vet’s prescription. The pills or topical are usually administered monthly and can be given to dogs under 6 months of age without a blood test. Older animals must be screened for the disease prior to starting medication.
            The American Heartworm Society recommends keeping your dog on the medication all year long. Not only does this avoid errors, but many of the products also prevent other intestinal parasites.
            Heartworm Treatment<br>
            
            After diagnosis, a thorough examination of the infected dog should be conducted to evaluate the best course of treatment and the potential risks involved.
            
            The most common course of treatment is a series of injections of drugs called adulticides into the dogs’ muscle. This cure has a high success rate and usually requires hospitalization.
            All treatment protocols require several weeks of exercise restriction after treatment and are not without risk. Disease prevention is a much better and safer option.
            After treatment, your dog should be placed on a preventative medication to reduce the risk of infection.
            When to Consult Your Veterinarian
            
            If you notice that your dog’s energy has decreased, he seems ill, or he’s exhibiting any of the general symptoms described above, please contact your veterinary immediately.</p>
    <h2>RABIES</h2>
    <p>There are several reported routes of transmission of the rabies virus.

        Rabies is most often transmitted through a bite from an infected animal.
        Less frequently, it can be passed on when the saliva of an infected animal enters another animal’s body through mucous membranes or an open, fresh wound.
        The risk for contracting rabies runs highest if your dog is exposed to wild animals. Outbreaks can occur in populations of wild animals (most often raccoons, bats, skunks and foxes in this country) or in areas where there are significant numbers of unvaccinated, free-roaming dogs and cats.
        Rabies Prevention
        
        Vaccination is the key—and in many areas of the country, such as New York City, it's the law.
        Some local ordinances require lengthy quarantines—or euthanasia—of pets who have bitten someone if their owners do not have proof of current vaccination.
        Vaccinating your dog doesn't just protect him from rabies—it also protects your dog if he bites someone. Dogs who have bitten humans are required to be confined for at least 10 days to see if rabies develops.
        Avoiding contact with wild animals is also necessary to prevention. Walk your dog on a leash and supervise him while he’s outsoodrs.
        Symptoms of Rabies
        
        Animals will not show signs immediately following exposure to a rabid animal. Symptoms can be varied and can take between two and eight weeks to incubate. Classic signs of rabies in dogs include:
        <ul>
        <li>Changes in behavior (including restlessness, apprehension, aggression or irritability)</li>
        <li>Biting or snapping at any form of stimulus</li>
        <li>Attacking other animals, humans and even inanimate objects</li>
        <li>Licking, biting and chewing at the bite site</li>
        <li>Fever</li>
        <li>Hypersensitivity</li>
       <li> Loss of appetite</li>
        <li>Weakness</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h5>Diagnosing Rabies</h5>
        
        There is no accurate test to diagnose rabies in live animals.
        The direct fluorescent antibody test is the most accurate test for diagnosis, but it can only be performed after the death of the animal on brain tissue.
        There is no treatment or cure for rabies once symptoms appear. The disease results in death.
        
       <h5>What to Do if Your Dog Interacts With a Rabid Animal</h5>
        
        Call your veterinarian for an immediate appointment!
        Contact local animal control officers if the animal who bit your pet is still at large; they will be best able to safely apprehend and remove the animal from the environment.
        The rabies virus may remain alive on your pet’s skin for up to two hours. It is best not to touch your dog during this time. If you must handle your dog, wear gloves and protective clothing.
        A dog who is up to date with his vaccinations and who has been bitten by a possibly rabid animal should also be given a rabies booster vaccine immediately and kept under observation (length will vary depending on your state laws).
        If you think you’ve been bitten by a rabid animal, see your doctor immediately!
        Note: Do not attempt to handle or capture a wild animal who is acting strangely (i.e., a nocturnal animal who is out during the day, an animal who acts unusually tame). Report the animal to local animal control officers as soon as possible.</p>
