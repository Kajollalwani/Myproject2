    <h1>Flystrike in Rabbits</h1>
    <p>Flystrike, also known as myiasis, is a dangerous condition that can affect rabbits. It occurs when flies lay eggs on a rabbit's soiled fur or open wounds, leading to maggot infestation. Here are some common symptoms of flystrike in rabbits:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Presence of maggots (larvae) on or near the rabbit's rear end or wounds.</li>
        <li>Foul odor from the affected area.</li>
        <li>Restlessness, excessive grooming, or biting at the affected area.</li>
        <li>Swelling, redness, or discharge from the infested area.</li>
        <li>Signs of pain or discomfort, such as reduced activity and appetite.</li>
        <li>In severe cases, shock and collapse may occur.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Causes of Diabetes</h2>
    <p>Diabetes is a chronic metabolic condition. There are different types of diabetes, and their causes can vary:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Type 1 Diabetes:</strong> Autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing cells.</li>
        <li><strong>Type 2 Diabetes:</strong> Insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion.</li>
        <li><strong>Gestational Diabetes:</strong> Occurs during pregnancy due to hormonal changes.</li>
        <li><strong>Other Types:</strong> Rare genetic forms and secondary diabetes from other medical conditions or medications.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Treating Diabetes</h2>
    <p>The treatment of diabetes depends on the type and severity of the condition:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Type 1 Diabetes:</strong> Insulin therapy, typically through injections or an insulin pump.</li>
        <li><strong>Type 2 Diabetes:</strong> Lifestyle changes (diet and exercise) and sometimes oral medications or insulin.</li>
        <li><strong>Gestational Diabetes:</strong> Monitoring blood glucose levels, a controlled diet, and insulin if necessary during pregnancy.</li>
        <li><strong>Other Types:</strong> Treatment depends on the specific type and underlying causes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preventing Diabetes</h2>
    <p>Prevention plays a significant role in managing and reducing the risk of diabetes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Maintain a healthy diet with balanced carbohydrates, fiber, and low sugar intake.</li>
        <li>Engage in regular physical activity to help regulate blood sugar levels.</li>
        <li>Manage body weight to reduce the risk of Type 2 diabetes.</li>
        <li>Avoid excessive alcohol consumption and smoking.</li>
        <li>Regular medical check-ups, especially if you have risk factors for diabetes.</li>
        <li>Gestational diabetes prevention involves monitoring and maintaining a healthy lifestyle during pregnancy.</li>
    </ul>
